# Array in Java


* An array in Java is a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same data type.
* It provides a convenient way to store and access multiple values using a single variable name.
* Arrays are widely used in programming to store and manipulate large sets of data efficiently.

In Java, arrays are declared by specifying the data type of the elements followed by square brackets `[]`.
The size of the array is determined at the time of declaration and remains fixed throughout its lifetime.
Once the array is created, individual elements can be accessed using their index, which starts from 0 for the first element, 1 for the second element and so on. 

Thing to keep in mind: [ The index of the last element is one less than the size of the array ]

Here's an example of declaring and initializing an array in Java:

```java
// Declare an array of integers
int[] numbers;

// we can only determie the size of array and later assign the values 

// Initialize the array with values
numbers = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Declaring the array with fixed size
// int numbers = new int[10];

// initializing or modifying  the array later 
numbers[0]=5;
numbers[1]=10;


// Accessing array elements
int firstElement = numbers[0]; // Accessing the first element
int length = numbers.length; // Getting the length of the array

```

Arrays in Java offer several useful operations and properties. Some of the commonly used operations include:

* Accessing elements: Elements in an array can be accessed using their index.
  ```java
   int firstElement = numbers[0]; 
   ```
* Modifying elements: Array elements can be modified by assigning new values to specific indices.
  ```java
   numbers[1]=10; 
   ```
* Iterating over elements: Arrays can be traversed using loops such as for or while to perform operations on each element.
```java
 for(int i=0;i<numbers.lenght;i++){
//this will print the elements of the array in their respective order
System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```
* Finding the length: The length of an array can be obtained using the length property.
```java
 int lenghtOfArry=numbers.length; 
 ```
* Sorting elements: The java.util.Arrays class provides various sorting methods to sort the elements of an array.
  
Arrays provide a compact and efficient way to store and manipulate data in Java. 
However, it's important to note that arrays have a fixed size, and once created, their size cannot be changed dynamically. To overcome this limitation, other data structures like ArrayList can be used.
