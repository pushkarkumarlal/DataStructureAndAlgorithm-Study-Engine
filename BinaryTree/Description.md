# Binary Tree Introduction

## What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The top node of the tree is the root. Each node can have a value associated with it, forming a tree-like structure.

## Key Terminology
- **Node**: An element in the tree holding a value and references to its children.
- **Root**: The topmost node, serving as the starting point for traversing the tree.
- **Parent**: A node with one or more child nodes.
- **Child**: Nodes directly connected to a parent node.
- **Leaf**: A node with no children, found at the end of a branch.
- **Depth**: The level of a node in the tree (root is at depth 0).
- **Height**: The length of the longest path from a node to a leaf.

## Structure and Types of Binary Trees
Different binary tree structures include:
- **Full Binary Tree**: Nodes have 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, filled from left to right.
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: Internal nodes have exactly 2 children, and leaf nodes are at the same level.
- **Balanced Binary Tree**: Subtrees of nodes differ in height by at most 1.

## Binary Tree Representation
Two common representations:
1. **Linked Representation**: Nodes are objects with data and pointers to left and right children.
2. **Array Representation**: Binary tree stored in an array, with index-based parent-child relationships.

## Tree Traversal
Three common traversal types:
1. **In-order Traversal**: Left subtree, root, right subtree.
2. **Pre-order Traversal**: Root, left subtree, right subtree.
3. **Post-order Traversal**: Left subtree, right subtree, root.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)
BST is a special binary tree where values in left subtree are <= root's value, and values in right subtree are > root's value. Enables efficient search, insertion, deletion.

## Common Operations
- **Searching**: Efficient in a BST by comparing values and navigating left or right.
- **Insertion**: Add a node by following the BST property.
- **Deletion**: Reorganize tree while maintaining BST property.

## Applications
Binary trees have many uses:
- Binary Search Trees for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Expression Trees for mathematical expressions.
- Huffman Trees for data compression.
- Decision Trees for algorithmic decision-making.

## Practice and Learning
Practice constructing, performing operations, and understanding traversals. Implement algorithms and solve programming problems related to binary trees for hands-on learning.
